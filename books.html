  <h2>Reading</h2>
  <p>
    A snapshot of what I've been reading lately.
    I've taken the design from <a href="https://sivers.org/book">Derek Siver's
      </a> (a prolific blogger and reader) "Books I've Read" page, and tweaked
      it to fit my style.
    You can access full reviews, book notes, ISBN numbers, and links to the
      books on Amazon under "More Details".
  </p> 
  <h3>A Note on Notes</h3>
  <p>
    These notes are not a summary.
    They are decontextualized snippets of information to help me remember what
      Iâ€™ve learned.
    If you enjoy reading them too, great!
    Go read the book.

        I was transported to Tuscany. 
        An engaging read for fans of historical and war-time fiction.
