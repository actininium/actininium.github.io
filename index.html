    <h3><a href="/posts/convention">How to Be Unconventional</a></h3>
    <p>
      North American media bombards us with slogans such as <q>break the 
        rules</q> and <q>find your own path.</q> 
      Demoralizing advertising tells us that we are not enough, so we accept 
        these vague directives without considering what actually constitutes
        uniqueness.
      We then look for the easy fix—<a href="/posts/originality" 
        target="_blank"> buy products that promise personality</a>—and we end
        up where we started, yearning to become more ourselves. 
    </p>	
    <p>
      You are unique. 
      You don’t need to broadcast you character. 
      In fact, silent confidence cuts through the noise better than more 
        noise. 
      That said, breaking conventions can be liberating in art and self 
        expression. 
      So the question remains: which conventions are worth breaking?

	 <h3><a href="/posts/read">Writers Read</a></h3>
	 <p>
      Writers read.
	   Otherwise, words become trapped.
	   You reach for them as they lie slumbering, mired in mental sludge.
		But when you read, words become alive, buzzing with enough energy to 
		  dislodge from the muck.
		They flow from your pen, seeming to originate from outside of you, 
		  and you write with more insight than ever before.	  
	 </p>

		Some <a

		  target="_blank">authors</a> <a href=
		  "https://www.ted.com/talks/elizabeth_gilbert_on_genius?language=en" 
		  target="_blank">think</a> that great ideas do not originate from us, 
		  but from muses—spirits from Greek and Roman mythology that love 
		  nothing more than to bring great art into the world through humans.
		However, these muses only help those who consistently work to better 
		  their technique, so that when inspiration strikes, they can execute 
		  their ideas to the best of their abilities.

      Will you be ready when your muse comes calling?

    <h3><a href="/posts/action-theory">The Theory of Doing</a></h3>
    <p>
      Two months ago, creative minds had the same idea about creation: action 
        is better than theory.
		Within two weeks, YouTubers <a target="_blank"

		  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dxcO26i9uw">
		  Vlog Brothers</a>, and <a target="_blank" 
		  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVnPqQpMfwU">Cody Wanner</a> 
		  published videos encouraging people to <q>just do it.</q>
		Work on your projects every day and you will improve.
		But how does theory fit in?

  <h2><a href="/books">Reading</a></h2>
  <p>
    A snapshot of what I've been reading lately.
    I've taken the design from <a href="https://sivers.org/book">Derek Siver's
      </a> (a prolific blogger and reader) "Books I've Read" page, and tweaked
      it to fit my style.
    You can access full reviews, book notes, ISBN numbers, and links to the
      books on Amazon under "More Details".
