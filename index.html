			On the bus I saw an ad for a vintage clothing store that read “Where originals originate.”
		I wanted to be just as cool as the models oozing confidence and style, but something about the slogan seemed off.

			Pop sucks.
			Rap is trash. 
			The blues is dead.
			Classical is overrated. . .
			If we believed this constant barrage of genre-hate, no music would be worth listening to.

			Some people believe that the only songs worth listening to are the ones they like.
			What they do not realize is that <strong>everyone's experience of music is subjective</strong>.
			There is no 'best' genre.
		</p>

			The difference between taste and quality is best explored with a metaphor.
			I'll use clothing, as preference for what we wear is just as individual as what we listen to. . .
