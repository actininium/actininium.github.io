			<strong>Preface</strong>
		</p>
	
		<p>
			In light of creating this blog and starting a YouTube channel, I set out some rules for myself so that my online activities do not dominate my life.
			You may also find them useful.
		</p>
	
		<p>
			Note: I use the term ‘artist’ to refer to anyone who regularly engages in the act of creation—especially those who share their work online—whether through writing, music, vlogging or running a business.
			Feel free to adapt this to suit your medium.

			<strong>Artists' Pact</strong>

			I, <span id="underline">Alex Maplestone</span>, hereby pledge that:

		<ol>
			
		<li>
			I realize no matter how passionate I feel about my art. . .

		<p>
			There is always going to be someone better or worse than you at a given pursuit.
			Someone is always going to learn faster or slower than you, be stronger or weaker than you, and work harder or slack off more than you.
			Even if you are at the top (or bottom) of your field now, give it a year or fifty and someone will overtake you.
			Therefore, <strong>it is useless to compare yourself to others</strong>, to justify your failures with “but they’re smarter than me,” and your successes with “but I work harder than them.”
			A healthy dose of friendly competition can be motivating, but the comparative mindset that so many of us operate with is damaging to our growth.
			You lose sight of your own journey and instead fight to stay ahead of everyone, leaving the validation of your worthiness to others who may not care. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>This is not meant to be disheartening, but liberating</strong>.
			By asking yourself the right questions, you gain a clearer sense of your strengths and weaknesses, learn more from your mistakes, and better appreciate your accomplishments – you can supercharge your growth. 
			So ask yourself: <strong>are you better than you were before?</strong>

		<p>
			On the bus I saw an ad for a vintage clothing store that read “Where originals originate.”
		I wanted to be just as cool as the models oozing confidence and style, but something about the slogan seemed off.
		How could buying some clothes transform an average person into an original one?
		</p>
  
		<p>
			Well, assuming the store sells unique clothing. . .
