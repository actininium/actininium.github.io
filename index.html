	 <p>
      Writers read.
	   Otherwise, words become trapped.
	   You reach for them as they lie slumbering, mired in mental sludge.
		But when you read, words become alive, buzzing with enough energy to 
		dislodge from the muck.
		They flow from your pen, seeming to originate from outside of you, 
		and you write with more insight than ever before.

		from us, but from muses—spirits from Greek and Roman mythology that love
		nothing more than to bring great art into the world through humans.
		However, these muses only help those who consistently work to better 
		their technique, so that when inspiration strikes, they can execute 
		their ideas to the best of their abilities.

		Within two weeks, YouTubers <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksDDSIlTe3w">Peter McKinnon</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dxcO26i9uw">Vlog Brothers</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVnPqQpMfwU">Cody Wanner</a> published videos encouraging people to “just do it.”

    <h3><a href="/posts/why">Where's the Why?</a></h3>
    <p>
	   It seems to me that writers often leave out the <q>why</q> in their 
	   advice articles.
