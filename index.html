	 <p>
      Writers read.
	   Otherwise, words become trapped.
	   You reach for them as they lie slumbering, mired in mental sludge.
		But when you read, words become alive, buzzing with enough energy to 
		dislodge from the muck.
		They flow from your pen, seeming to originate from outside of you, 
		and you write with more insight than ever before.

		from us, but from muses—spirits from Greek and Roman mythology that love
		nothing more than to bring great art into the world through humans.
		However, these muses only help those who consistently work to better 
		their technique, so that when inspiration strikes, they can execute 
		their ideas to the best of their abilities.

    <h3><a href="/posts/action-theory">The Theory of Doing</a></h3>
    <p>
      Two months ago, creative minds had the same idea about creation: action 
      is better than theory.
		Within two weeks, YouTubers <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube

		and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVnPqQpMfwU"

    <h3><a href="/posts/why">Where's the Why?</a></h3>
    <p>
	   It seems to me that writers often leave out the <q>why</q> in their

  <h2>Reading</h2>
  <p>
    A snapshot of what I've been reading lately.
    I've taken the design from 
    <a href="https://sivers.org/book">Derek Siver's</a> 
    (a prolific blogger and reader) "Books I've Read" page, and tweaked it to fit my style.
    You can accesss full reviews, book notes, ISBN numbers, and links to the books on Amazon
    under "More Details".
