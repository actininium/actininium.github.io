		Writers read.
		Otherwise, words become trapped.
		You reach for them as they lie slumbering, mired in mental sludge.
		But when you read, words become alive, buzzing with enough energy to dislodge from the muck.
		They flow from your pen, seeming to originate from outside of you, and you write with more insight than ever before.
	</p>

		Some <a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/2013/10/you-as-the-muse-sees-you/">authors</a> <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/elizabeth_gilbert_on_genius?language=en">think</a> that great ideas do not originate from us, but from muses—spirits from Greek and Roman mythology that love nothing more than to bring great art into the world through humans.
		However, these muses only help those who consistently work to better their technique, so that when inspiration strikes, they can execute their ideas to the best of their abilities.

	<p>
		Will you be ready when your muse comes calling?
